    <p>I am an aspiring software developer who is constantly improving on my skills and learning more about the industry.
    I am not new to computers, but I have primarily been on the hardware side before I began learning Javascript. I am from Raleigh, North Carolina. 
    I enjoy outdoor activities such as backpacking and basketball, but I also enjoy watching movies and reading books. 
    I became interested in programming through my brother in law, and some of my friends from high school.
    I look forward having to the limetless potential that programming offers to those who put in the time and effort.
